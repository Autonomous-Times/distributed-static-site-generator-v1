# Autonomous times


comprehensive approach to collaborative writing and publishing

primitives for sharing of markdown texts that are:

* versioned
* encrypted
* can be shared, collaborated upon
* agnostic to editors

* ownership is registered on chain 
* authors can make on chain deals with publishers that do not transfer, but share ownership 
* these deals can be temporary and/or rescinded by both parties

* publishers are structured as on chain decentralised autonomous organisations
* html is generated and deleted by a neutral static site generator acting on on-chain deals
* webhosting is provided by marketplace of compute providers.
